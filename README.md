# Overview

This is a small CRUD full stack app called EmployeeCMS which is supposed to emulate a Employee Management system that would keep track of employee information in a company. The frontend of the application was built with Vue.js and the backend is done through NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. Users can create, read, update, and delete employee information.
